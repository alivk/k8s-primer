## Purpose
Imagine you are driving up a hill in a high gear and the car starts to slow down.
You have two choices.
You can either carry on in the hope your momentum will take you safely over the hill or you can drop down a gear and let the engine work harder.
The latter option will work (almost) all of the time.
The point is, it is not always desirable or efficient to slow down, but it is sometimes the necessary choice to get to where you are heading quickly.

So, you know a thing about computing and you know what a process is, right?

Well, maybe you know enough to get by, but do you know what you need to progress with speed?
In order to learn Kubernetes with confidence you will likely benefit from revisiting the **Linux process** to gain a renewed appreciation how they behave and what unusual "tricks" they are capable of.
