## Purpose
Imagine you are cycling up a hill in a high gear and the bicycle starts to slow down.
You have two choices.
You can either carry on in the hope your momentum and strength will take you safely over the hill or you can drop down a gear and pedal faster.
The latter option will (almost) always enable you to progres to the next hill.
The point is, it is not always desirable or efficient to slow down but it is sometimes necessary choice to progress.

So, as experienced technicians you know what a process is, correct?
Of course you do.

Well, you likely know enough to get by, but do you know the detail required to progress to the next hill without stalling?
In order to learn Kubernetes with confidence you will likely benefit from revisiting the **Linux process** to gain a renewed appreciation how they interract with each other and the "quirky tricks" they are capable of.
