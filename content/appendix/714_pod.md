## What's in a Pod?

In [Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/downloads/pdf/romeo-and-juliet_PDF_FolgerShakespeare.pdf), Act 2 Scene 2, Juliet declares:
> "Whatâ€™s in a name? That which we call a rose  
  By any other word would smell as sweet."

And we may duly ask:
> "What's in a namespace? That which we call a pod  
  By any other namespaces would smell as containerish."

## Purpose

The purpose of this lesson is for you to investigate what makes a container a container in Kubernetes, and what makes a pod a pod.

## Namespaces, Containers, and Pods, oh my!

In Kubernetes, we speak of pods. But what are they *really* made of? Are they made of sugar, and spice, and everything nice?

- `Pod` objects are the most basic unit of scheduled compute power in Kubernetes.
- You can implement a microservice or API in a pod.
- You can create multiple containers in a pod. This is for division of labor within that one instance of the pod.
- You can create workloads of multiple pods such as a `DaemonSet`, `ReplicaSet`, or `Deployment`. This horizontal scaling is for redundancy for resilience and high availability, as well as to support load distribution for performance. You would typically put a `Service` in front of the workload to actually distribute the load.

But what are pods made of? 
In the [Linux Namespaces section]({{< ref "014_linux_namespaces" >}}) you hopefully used the Linux commands `unshare` to create new namespaces for processes and `nsenter` to join processes to existing namespaces.
You could review any of the following sections if you want more details on the following types of namespaces:
- [`UTS` (UNIX time sharing) namespaces]({{< ref "014_linux_namespaces#uts-namespaces" >}})
- [`PID` (Process subtree) namespaces]({{< ref "014_linux_namespaces#pid-namespaces" >}}) 
- [`MNT` (filesystem Mount) namespaces]({{< ref "016_run_containers#within-you-without-you" >}})
- [`NET` (Network) namespaces]({{< ref "appendix/732_veth_encore" >}}) - and its prelude on [`VETH Pairs`]({{< ref "appendix/730_veth_pairs" >}})

Now, you can investigate how these different namespaces are combined in Kubernetes to create containers and pods!

{{< step >}}Create a Pod with one container.{{< /step >}}

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee ~/environment/901-demo-solo.yaml | kubectl -n dev apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod                    # the object schema Kubernetes uses to validate this manifest
metadata:
  name: demosolo             # a name for your POD
  labels:
    app: demo
    style: solo
    count: "1"
spec:
  containers:                # a pod CAN consist of multiple containers, this one has only one
  - name: demox              # a name for your first CONTAINER
    image: demo:1.0.0        # the tagged image we previously injected using "kind load"
    command:
    - php                    # where to start the container
    args:
    - -S                     # change the server IP + port binding to listen on
    - 127.0.0.1:9081         # use a unique port per container in the pod
EOF
```

{{< output >}}
pod/demosolo created
{{< /output >}}

{{% notice note %}}
You could deploy this `demosolo` Pod via a `Deployment` or `DaemonSet`.
Note that the `labels` have been assigned to make it easy to search for 
and manage multiple pods with the same `app`, `style`, or `count`.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< step >}}Check which node your pod is running on.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dev -o wide
```

{{< output >}}
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Capture the node name in a shell variable `demonode`:{{< /step >}}

```bash
demonode=$(kubectl get pod demosolo -n dev -o jsonpath={.spec.nodeName})
```

{{< step >}}Get a list of processes running on that node.{{< /step >}}

```bash
docker exec $demonode ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd
```

NOTE: The following example output has been *pruned for clarity*.
{{< output >}}

   1056    1034 /pause
   1087    1034 php -S 127.0.0.1:9081
{{< /output >}}

{{% notice note %}}
Your nodes will be running other software such as `journald`.
Your nodes should also be running pods `kube-proxy` and `kindnet`.
Those will follow the same pattern as your pod described below.
{{% /notice %}}

Note your `php` process running `php -S 127.0.0.1:9081` as seen from the node's perspective.

{{< step >}}What is the parent process id (PPID) of your `php` process?{{< /step >}}

The parent of the `php` container in your pod should be a `containerd-shim-runc-v2`.
In the example shown here, that was process id 1034. Your process id will most likely be different.

{{< step >}}Is there another process in the node's perspective with the same parent process id?{{< /step >}}

There should be a `pause` container with the same parent. 
This `pause` container was added by Kubernetes to your pod.
As it has the same parent as your container, you could call it a *sibling* container.

{{% notice note %}}
Kubernetes adds a `pause` container to each pod. Its purpose will be described shortly.
In many management views, the `pause` containers are hidden.
You are now looking beneath the hood.
{{% /notice %}}

How would you check what container image is being used for that `pause` container?

{{< step >}}Connect into that node and query the container runtime interface (CRI) for a list of images.{{< /step >}}

```bash
docker exec $demonode crictl images
```

Example output:

## What are little containers made of?

{{< step >}}Get a list of Linux namespaces in this worker node.{{< /step >}}

```bash
docker exec $demonode lsns 
```

Example *trimmed* output.

{{< output >}}
        NS TYPE   NPROCS   PID USER  COMMAND
4026532822 net         2  1056 65535 /pause
4026532898 mnt         1  1056 65535 /pause
4026532899 uts         2  1056 65535 /pause
4026532900 ipc         2  1056 65535 /pause
4026532901 pid         1  1056 65535 /pause
4026532902 mnt         1  1087 root  php -S 127.0.0.1:9081
4026532903 pid         1  1087 root  php -S 127.0.0.1:9081
{{< /output >}}

NOTE: The example output has been *trimmed for clarity* to only include those namespaces used by:
- your `php` container
- your `php` container's sibling `pause` container (i.e. in the same pod)

{{< step >}}Find your `php` process. Which two Linux namespaces is that in?{{< /step >}}

Your `php` process should have been created in two namespaces. 
Note the process id. That should correlate to the output from `ps` you obtained earlier.

{{< step >}}What are the types of those two namespaces?{{< /step >}}

Your `php` process should be in its own distinct `mnt` and `pid` namespaces.

{{% notice note %}}
This node's `kubelet` asked the container runtime (`containerd` and `runc`) to create your process.
Those two namespaces ***are*** the container around your process, which ***make*** it a container.
{{% /notice %}}

What about your `php` container's *sibling*--the `pause` container?

{{< step >}}Find the `pid` and `mnt` namespaces of the `pause` container.{{< /step >}}

Those two namespaces make the pause process a container.

## Peas in a Pod

Your `php` container and its `pause` container sibling are running in the same Kubernetes `pod`.

Like your containers, your pod is created from Linux namespaces as well.

Look at the output from `lsns` above where you listed the namespaces in the one worker node running your pod.

{{< step >}}Find the namespaces with 2 for the the number of processes `NPROCS`.{{< /step >}}

There should be three.

{{< step >}}What are the types of these namespaces?{{< /step >}}

You should have a `net`, a `uts`, and an `ipc` namespace with the same pid as your pod's `pause` container.

{{% notice note %}}
When your node's `kubelet` asked the container runtime (`containerd` and `runc`) to 
create your `php` container and its `pause` sibling container, 
they also created these three additional Linux namespaces around ***both*** containers.
These three namespaces ***form*** the pod around your containers.

This means that:
- the containers in your pod share the same IP addresses, TCP and UDP port number space, hostname, and inter-process communications.

## Success

In this lesson, you:
- Created a singleton pod--a pod with one container
- Discovered that your container is not alone--it has a sibling container running the `pause` image
- Revealed and reaffirmed that Kubernetes containers are made of processes in `pid` and `mnt` namespaces
- Revealed that Kubernetes pods are made of containers in shared `net`, `uts`, and `ipc` namespaces
