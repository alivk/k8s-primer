## What's in a Pod?

In [Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/downloads/pdf/romeo-and-juliet_PDF_FolgerShakespeare.pdf), Act 2 Scene 2, Juliet declares:
> "Whatâ€™s in a name? That which we call a rose  
  By any other word would smell as sweet."

And we may duly ask:
> "What's in a namespace? That which we call a pod  
  By any other namespaces would smell as containerish."

## Namespaces, Containers, and Pods, oh my!

In Kubernetes, we speak of pods. But what are they *really* made of? Are they made of sugar, and spice, and everything nice?

- `Pod` objects are the most basic unit of scheduled compute power in Kubernetes.
- You can implement a microservice or API in a pod.
- You can create multiple containers in a pod. This is for division of labor within that one instance of the pod.
- You can create workloads of multiple pods such as a `DaemonSet`, `ReplicaSet`, or `Deployment`. This horizontal scaling is for redundancy for resilience and high availability, as well as to support load distribution for performance. You would typically put a `Service` in front of the workload to actually distribute the load.

But what are pods made of? 
In the [Linux Namespaces section]({{< ref "014_linux_namespaces" >}}) you hopefully used the Linux commands `unshare` to create new namespaces for processes and `nsenter` to join processes to existing namespaces.
You could review any of the following sections if you want more details on the following types of namespaces:
- [`UTS` (UNIX time sharing) namespaces]({{< ref "014_linux_namespaces#uts-namespaces" >}})
- [`PID` (Process subtree) namespaces]({{< ref "014_linux_namespaces#pid-namespaces" >}}) 
- [`MNT` (filesystem Mount) namespaces]({{< ref "016_run_containers#within-you-without-you" >}})
- [`NET` (Network) namespaces]({{< ref "appendix/732_veth_encore" >}}) - and its prelude on [`VETH Pairs`]({{< ref "appendix/730_veth_pairs" >}})

Now, you can investigate how these different namespaces are combined in Kubernetes to create containers and pods!
