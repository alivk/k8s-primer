## Purpose

Deployments, daemonsets, and rag tag collections of bare pods provide a way for you to provision *compute* power into your Kubernetes clusters. For example, a common definition of a `Deployment` is a collection of pods and a means of provisioning them. But how do we reach those pods individually or collectively via the network? Each pod will have its own IP address. You would need to provide a specific IP address to get to any one pod. How can you distribute traffic to the collective of pods?

Another complexity: pods are ephemeral. Node maintenance, container image upgrades, pod configuration updates, and scale out and scale in can evict and create pods as needed. Therefore, you cannot count on the same set of pods being consistent over time. Thus, the set of IP addresses and corresponding DNS names assigned to pods in a deployment, daemonset, or even bare pod will change over time.

If only there were some way in Kubernetes to specify a means of ***accessing*** a collection of pods over the network. There is! It is a *separate* Kubernetes kind of object: [`Service`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

## Find the API Version for Service

Like the `Pod`, `Service` objects are a fundamental resource in Kubernetes.

{{< step >}}Find the API version for the `Service` kind.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl api-resources | head -1; kubectl api-resources | grep svc
```

{{< output >}}
NAME        SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION    NAMESPACED   KIND
services    svc          v1            true         Service
{{< /output >}}

- Use `apiVersion: v1` like for pods, different than daemonsets and deployments.
- Use `kind: Service` when declaring services.

## Select Pods By Label

How do we select the pods that should be included in a `Service`? By matching labels the pods have. See [labels and selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) for details.

However, being a `v1` resource type, `Service` objects use a *simple* style of label matching for their `selector`, like the legacy `ReplicationController`. 

{{% notice note %}}
Note that the `apps/v1` kinds of resources (e.g. `ReplicaSet`, `Deployment`, and `DaemonSet`) can use either `matchLabels` like the simple style or `matchExpressions` for set operations (i.e. members of a list). These more advanced modern choices are referred to as [Label selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors).
{{% /notice %}}

{{< step >}}List the services in your cluster.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get service -A
```

{{< output >}}
NAMESPACE     NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
default       kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP                  8h
kube-system   kube-dns     ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   8h
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Look at the selector used in `kube-dns`{{< /step >}}


<!-- skip this shenanigans, just grep for the relevant bit: kubectl get service kube-dns -n kube-system -o yaml >~/environment/112-kube-dns-svc.yaml -->

```bash
kubectl get service kube-dns -n kube-system -o yaml | grep selector -A 1
```

{{< output >}}
  selector:
    k8s-app: kube-dns
{{< /output >}}

The simple selector used in `Service` objects contains a single `key: value` pair to match a label in the pods you want to reach.

## Write a ClusterIP Manifest

{{< step >}}Write a simple `Service` manifest.{{< /step >}}

```yaml
cat <<EOF >~/environment/113-demo-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: demo
  ports:

EOF
```

{{% notice note %}}
This service requires that you have a `dev` namespace and a `demo` deployment provisioned into it.

## Provision Your Service

{{< step >}}Provision the `Service` into the `dev` namespace.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/environment/113-demo-service.yaml -n dev
```

{{< output >}}
service/demo-service created
{{< /output >}}

Congratulations, you have deployed a service to Kubernetes.

But how do you use it? What is it made of? How does it work? Is it a single point of failure that adds another hop and more latency on the way to your precious pods?

## Inspect Your Service

{{< step >}}Get the properties of your `Service`.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get service demo-service -n dev
```

{{< output >}}
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
demo-service   ClusterIP   10.96.143.4   <none>        80/TCP    12m
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Show the YAML form of your `Service` manifest.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get service demo-service -n dev -o yaml | tee ~/environment/114-demo-service-result.yaml
```

Your resultant service manifest should look like this. We left out some of the metadata properties here.

{{< output >}}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-service
  namespace: dev
  ... annotations, creationTimestamp, resourceVersion, uid ...

    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:

  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
{{< /output >}}

{{% notice note %}}
Each `Service` has a `clusterIP` property assigned to it. You *could* assign a value in your manifest, however you would normally leave that out and let the Kubernetes service controller automatically assign a value. 
{{% /notice %}}

What is the `type` of your service? `ClusterIP`. The service controller assigns this type to a service by default when you do not specify one. Other fancier service types inherit their fundamental nature from `ClusterIP` and have a `spec.clusterIP` property automatically assigned. This IP address is valid *within* the cluster, as the name implies.

Therefore, in order to get to your service, we need a vantage point *within* the cluster. Create another pod in your cluster to use as a *client* of your service.

<!-- inheriting jumpbox and some narrative from - https://github.com/amcginlay/eks-demos/blob/main/doc/12-clusterip-services/README.md -->

### Using `nginx` as a "jumpbox"

ClusterIP services are intended to establish dynamic communication channels between individual pods inside your cluster. To see this in action and troubleshoot problems it often helps to gain peer-level access to your workloads, just as you might do with a regular [jumpbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) (or bastion host) in the Amazon EC2 world.

{{< step >}}Use the `kubectl run` command to conveniently deploy [nginx](https://www.nginx.com) as a standalone pod which will serve as your "jumpbox".{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl run jumpbox --image=nginx                                # in default namespace
sleep 10 && kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- curl http://localhost:80 # test the NGINX welcome page
```

{{% notice note %}}
Note that, in the absence of an associated deployment object, your single "jumpbox" pod will not be automatically replaced in the event of a failure.

jumpbox -->|curl| jumpbox
{{< /mermaid >}}

You have proven that:
- you can connect into your `jumpbox` from Cloud9
- your `jumpbox` can talk to itself

Now for the real fun.

### What's in a service name?

Before you created your jumpbox, you created a `Deployment` and a `Service`. You may have noticed up the `clusterIP` property

{{< step >}}Check the default DNS suffix search list for your `jumpbox`.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

{{< output >}}
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local us-west-2.compute.internal
nameserver 10.96.0.10
options ndots:5
{{< /output >}}

Pods in your cluster, such as this `nginx` jumpbox pod, use DNS to resolve the names of other pods and the names of services. More on this soon.

{{< step >}}Attempt to connect from your jumpbox to your Kubernetes service.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- curl http://demo-service
```

{{< output >}}
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: demo-service
command terminated with exit code 6
{{< /output >}}

Now, look back at the DNS resolver suffix search list. the first three suffixes are:
- `default.svc.cluster.local`
- `svc.cluster.local`
- `cluster.local`

{{% notice note %}}
Upon creation, each service is allocated a long-term **internal** IP address which is scoped to the cluster and auto-registered within private [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) servers.
A private mapping from the DNS name of your service to its corresponding ClusterIP address is now in place so pods can now reach each other via DNS names.
{{% /notice %}}

This is utterly important. Let's break down the situation:
- You did not create your service in the `default` namespace where you `jumpbox` is.
- You created your service in the `dev` namespace.
- Services are registered in DNS with their `clusterIP` and ***service FQDN*** (DNS fully-qualified domain name).
- Service FQDNs use the notation: <service>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster-suffix>
- For example: `demo-service.dev.svc.cluster.local` is the name of your service, because:
  - you called it `demo-service`
  - you created it in the `dev` namespace
  - your cluster suffix is `cluster.local`

{{< step >}}Use a *partially* qualified name for your service. This depends on the `.svc.cluster.local` being added by the resolver.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- curl http://demo-service.dev
```

{{< output >}}
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-mvzs4
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Now do it again with a *fully* qualified name for your service.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- curl http://demo-service.dev.svc.cluster.local
```

{{< output >}}
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-26z78
{{< /output >}}

You have successfully connected to pods in your deployment ***via your service***!

## Traffic Distribution Amongst a Service's Pods

Did you get a response from the same pod with both requests? Whether you did or not, it is time to look deeper at how traffic is distributed to the selected pods in the service. The set of pods may change over time.

{{< step >}}Take the previous curl request and place it in a loop.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- /bin/bash -c "while true; do curl http://demo-service.dev.svc.cluster.local; sleep 0.25; done"
# ctrl+c to quit loop
```

Your output may look similar to this...

{{< output >}}
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-26z78
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-4jq2b
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-mvzs4
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-mvzs4
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-mvzs4
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-26z78
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-26z78

Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-26z78
Hello from demo-7c9cd496db-4jq2b
^Ccommand terminated with exit code 130
{{< /output >}}

Observe the hostname of the pods changing with the sequence of invocations.
Each of your pod replicas, which are spread across all the worker nodes, were each involved in servicing the requests.

Again:
- `Deployment` -- provisions replicas of a pod specification
- `Service` -- distributes communications to a collection of pods

Here is a graphical depiction of your deployment behind your service.

## Endpoints Can Change Over Time

<!-- earlier they did: kubectl get service demo-service -n dev -o yaml | tee ~/environment/114-demo-service-result.yaml -->

You know the name of your service and its FQDN. But what is its `clusterIP` address?

{{< step >}}Check the `clusterIP` value of your service.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get service demo-service -n dev -o yaml | grep clusterIP:
```

{{< output >}}
  clusterIP: 10.96.143.4
{{< /output >}}

The constancy of the service FQDN (e.g. `demo-service.dev.svc.cluster.local`) and the `clusterIP` (e.g. `10.96.143.4`) provide the bedrock of predictable communications architectures in many Kubernetes-deployed workloads.
But it is the flexibility and agility of how the `Service` maps to the pods that implement the actual behaviors (code) of the service that delivers many beneficial powers.

{{< step >}}Look at the mappings of your service to those pod `Endpoints` that implement it.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get endpoints -n dev
```

{{< output >}}
NAME           ENDPOINTS                                   AGE
demo-service   10.244.1.5:80,10.244.2.5:80,10.244.3.5:80   14h
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Scale in your `demo` deployment from 3 replicas to 2 pods.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl scale deployment demo -n dev --replicas 2
```

{{< output >}}
deployment.apps/demo scaled
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Check the results from a computing standpoint.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get deploy/demo -n dev
```

{{< output >}}
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
demo   2/2     2            2           16h
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Check the results from a networking perspective.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get endpoints -n dev
```

{{< output >}}
NAME           ENDPOINTS                     AGE
demo-service   10.244.1.5:80,10.244.2.5:80   16h
{{< /output >}}

Now there are only two pods and the change has been automatically reflected in the `Endpoints` object.
Just as `Deployment` manages one or more `ReplicaSet` objects which provision your pods, a `Service` manages the `Endpoints` object, which in turn manages underlying proxy tables on your nodes that handle the network plumbing.

{{< step >}}Scale out to 5 replicas.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl scale deployment demo -n dev --replicas 5
echo; sleep 4    # arbitrary wait time for scaling settling
kubectl get deploy/demo -n dev       
echo; sleep 4    # arbitrary wait time for plumbing settling
kubectl get endpoints -n dev
```

{{< output >}}
deployment.apps/demo scaled

NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
demo   5/5     5            5           16h

NAME           ENDPOINTS                                               AGE
demo-service   10.244.1.5:80,10.244.2.5:80,10.244.2.6:80 + 2 more...   16h
{{< /output >}}

The `Endpoints` are adjusted for the `Service` as the pods implementing the service change.

## Looking Under The Hood

Some common questions about Kubernetes services include:
1. How much overhead do services introduce?
2. Are services a single point of failure?

Kubernetes services are highly available, implemented throughout the cluster with cooperative redundant components.  Recall that Kubernetes provides orchestration. That is not just orchestration of pods and deployments. Kubernetes also provides orchestration of services, endpoints, and their network plumbing under the hood.

{{< step >}}Check to see if your cluster still has a record of the recent scaling events.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl get events -n dev | tail -2
```

{{< output >}}
29m         Normal   ScalingReplicaSet   deployment/demo              Scaled down replica set demo-7c9cd496db to 2
28m         Normal   ScalingReplicaSet   deployment/demo              Scaled up replica set demo-7c9cd496db to 5
{{< /output >}}

The `kube-proxy` daemonset runs a pod on each node--as daemonsets do--which helps keep your services' endpoints up-to-date. While a deep dive into the magic of `kube-proxy` is beyond the scope of this workshop, a few key insights might help you appreciate what its fundamental essential purpose is.

{{< step >}}Create a list of words related to network proxy, firewall, and network address translation (NAT) technologies to search for.{{< /step >}}

```bash
cat <<EOF >~/environment/115-proxy-words.txt
proxy
ipvs
iptables
netfilter
EOF
```

{{< step >}}Now search for those words in the logs of the pods in the `kube-proxy` daemonset.{{< /step >}}
```bash
for proxy in $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=kube-proxy -n kube-system -o jsonpath={.items[1].metadata.name}); do kubectl logs $proxy -n kube-system; done | grep -f ~/environment/115-proxy-words.txt
```

The output may look similar to this.

{{< output >}}

{{< /output >}}

{{% notice note %}}
The `kubectl get pods` part of that snippet gets a list of pods implementing the `kube-proxy` daemonset.
Although the `{.items[1].metadata.name}` is used here to pick ***only one*** of those pods, the notation `{.items[*].metdata.name}` would provide a list of all of those pods. Thus, the use of the `for`/`do`/`done` to keep with a common pattern you might use in the future. The `kubectl logs` portion gets the logs for that/those pods. The `grep` is used to focus on a few keywords. Note that you could use the `--since=5m` and `--tail=3` options on `kubectl logs` command (with appropriate time periods or line counts) to show relevant details about your pods, not just system pods.
{{% /notice %}}

When pods belonging to services are started/stopped, the `kube-proxy` pods on the worker nodes all simultaneously modify their node's network routes, creating a consistent kernel-level load distributor per service.
As a result, since this is done collaboratively on every node, it doesn't matter which worker node receives a client request for a service, the routing behaviour is consistently well distributed. Here is a note about [troubleshooting and debugging Kubernetes Services and `kube-proxy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-service/#is-the-kube-proxy-working).

Furthermore, the `kube-proxy`, `Service`, and `Endpoints` components are ***not in the data path*** from your clients to your pods. Those just *drive changes into* the underlying Linux operating system on your nodes. Thus, latency is minimized because these routing tables are implemented with Linux kernel features. 

Kubernetes typically uses one of two modes for implementing `kube-proxy`:
1. `ipvs` mode
2. `iptables` mode

The Kubernetes documentation on the [IP Virtual Server (IPVS)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/ipvs/README.md) mechanisms notes: "IPVS (IP Virtual Server) implements transport-layer load balancing, usually called Layer 4 LAN switching, as part of Linux kernel. ¶ IPVS runs on a host and acts as a load balancer in front of a cluster of real servers. IPVS can direct requests for TCP and UDP-based services to the real servers, and make services of real servers appear as virtual services on a single IP address."

IPVS actually uses the more traditional `iptables`, which is part of the `netfilter` project. As noted in the [netfilter/iptables](https://netfilter.org/) documentation: "The netfilter project enables packet filtering, network address [and port] translation (NA[P]T), packet logging, userspace packet queueing and other packet mangling."

In summary, you use services in Kubernetes to provide network access to your app components running in the cluster.

## Relationship of ClusterIP to other Service Types

You may hear about other types of services that build on `ClusterIP`. These are beyond the scope of this workshop, however deserve a brief mention. These can be a distraction. They do serve their purposes. However, as you come to better understand `ClusterIP`, you may likely come to believe that it is sufficient for many of your pod-to-pod communications needs.
- `NodePort` builds on `ClusterIP` by mapping any of the node IP addresses along with a specific port number into the underlying `ClusterIP`. This enables inbound communications from outside the cluster.
- `LoadBalancer` builds on `NodePort`--and thus `ClusterIP`--by allocating a load balancer service or mechanism that operates outside the cluster--that maps to the list of node port addresses. This allows external mechanisms to be involved as well in inbound communications from outside the cluster.
- `ExternalName` merely maps a `ClusterIP` to another DNS name, which could resolve to a "service" (in the general non-Kubernetes sense of the word) outside the cluster.
When you are ready to go beyond the capabilities of `ClusterIP` services, you may want to consider service meshes, which are quite beyond the scope of this workshop.

Here is a Venn Diagram depiction of these Kubernetes `Service` types.

## Success

In this training adventure, you have:
- Deployed a `Service` in your cluster (`demo-service`).
- Connected to your service from a client, using a name in the form `<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.
- Looked at the `Endpoints` mapped behind your `Service`.
- Scaled your `Deployment` in and out and noticed that the service's `Endpoints` adjusts accordingly.
- Noted that `iptables` is used by `kube-proxy` to map the network address and port translations (NAT+NPT) needed to plumb out the service endpoints.
